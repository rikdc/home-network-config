# Home Network Configuration Repository Rules

## Repository Context
This repository contains Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for a home lab environment with:
- Ansible automation for server provisioning and configuration
- K3s Kubernetes cluster configuration and applications
- Secrets management with HashiCorp Vault and External Secrets Operator
- Network services including DNS, databases, and storage

## System Architecture
The infrastructure consists of:
- K3s Kubernetes cluster (controller + worker nodes)
- DNS servers
- Database servers (MySQL and PostgreSQL)
- Storage servers
- Proxmox virtualization
- HashiCorp Vault for secrets management

## Rules for Working with This Repository

### General Guidelines
- Always lint code before committing using the make targets (make lint, make lint-yaml, make lint-ansible)
- Use declarative approaches where possible for infrastructure changes
- Document any manual steps or requirements in the appropriate markdown files
- Respect existing patterns and naming conventions
- When adding new K3s applications, follow the pattern in the example app directory
- Always handle secrets properly through the established Vault workflow

### Ansible Guidelines
- Always specify explicit versions for dependencies in requirements.yml
- Create new roles for reusable functionality
- Use variables from inventory/group_vars and inventory/host_vars
- Test changes on non-production servers before applying to the entire infrastructure
- Encrypt sensitive data using ansible-vault

### Kubernetes Guidelines
- Follow the structure of separating apps, platform, and system components
- Use namespaces appropriately as defined in namespaces.yaml
- When adding new applications, include appropriate resource limits
- Utilize the External Secrets Operator for managing sensitive data
- Ensure persistent storage is properly configured for stateful applications

### Secrets Management
- Never commit unencrypted secrets to the repository
- Use the established secrets workflow with HashiCorp Vault and External Secrets Operator
- Follow the documentation in docs/secrets-management.md
- Remember to backup Vault regularly

### Best Practices
- Document network configurations and IP assignments
- Maintain clear documentation for the setup procedures
- Test changes in isolation before applying to the whole infrastructure
- Consider high availability for critical services
- When troubleshooting, check the appropriate logs first before making changes

## Code Review Focus Areas
- Security: Proper handling of secrets and credentials
- Idempotency: Changes should be repeatable without causing issues
- Resource efficiency: Appropriate resource requests and limits
- Documentation: Clear explanations of changes and configurations
- Testing: Evidence that changes have been tested

## Technology-Specific Guidelines

### HashiCorp Vault
- Follow the quick start guide in docs/secrets-management.md
- Regularly rotate certificates and credentials
- Implement appropriate backup strategies

### K3s/Kubernetes
- Use ArgoCD for GitOps-based deployments
- Ensure proper namespace separation
- Configure appropriate resource requests and limits
- Use persistent volumes for stateful applications

### Network Services
- Document DNS configuration changes
- Maintain consistent naming conventions
- Ensure proper DHCP reservations for infrastructure components

When assisting with this repository, prioritize security, stability, and maintainability of the home lab infrastructure.
